# Financial Model Auditor 📊

This repository provides an automated auditing framework for Excel-based financial models. It utilizes a multi-agent persona architecture to perform comprehensive checks on structural integrity, logical consistency, formatting standards, and technical robustness across formulas, VBA macros, and Power Query transformations.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Audit Framework

The audit is orchestrated by the **Manager** agent, which coordinates specialized personas defined in the `.Jules/` directory. All agents output findings in a standardized format to ensure consistency and readability.

- **Manager 👔**: The orchestrator who delegates tasks to specialist personas and consolidates all findings into a single, professional report.
- **Architect 🏗️**: Focuses on structural robustness, scalability, master date spine alignment, and modularity.
- **Logic 🧠**: Verifies formula alignment with business context and identifies formula pattern breaks or hard-coded literals.
- **Efficiency ⚡**: Identifies model optimizations, including "Mega-Formulas" (>4,000 characters), unused assumptions, and redundant logic.
- **Sentry 🛡️**: Ensures technical integrity by checking for Excel error values (#REF!, #VALUE!, etc.) and calculation errors.
- **Stylist 🎨**: Detects and enforces formatting conventions (colors, fonts, styles) using style guides or statistical inference.
- **Lingo 🗣️**: Performs linguistic scans for typos and ensures consistent terminology across labels and headings.
- **VBA Agent 💻**: Inspects VBA modules for security risks, deprecated functions, and code efficiency.
- **Power Query Agent 🔍**: Audits M-code for performance bottlenecks, hard-coded file paths, and transformation logic.

## 📋 Standard Audit Output

Every agent in the framework adheres to the following standardized Markdown table format for reporting findings:

| Column | Description | VBA / Power Query Mapping |
|---|---|---|
| **Sheet Name** | The name of the worksheet where the issue was found. | Module Name (VBA) or Query Name (PQ) |
| **Cell Reference** | The specific cell(s) affected (e.g., A1, B5:M10). | Line Number or Procedure/Step Name |
| **Description of the Location** | Contextual description (e.g., "Revenue row", "Tax calc"). | Variable name or specific code block |
| **Short Error Category** | A brief classification (e.g., "Typo", "Logic Error"). | e.g., "Security", "Performance", "Hard-coded Path" |
| **Long Description of Error** | Detailed explanation of the finding and its impact. | Full technical details of the code issue |

## 📏 Standards & Conventions

Financial models in this repository are expected to follow best-practice conventions:

- **Inputs**: Consistent font color (e.g., Dark Red #800000) and no fill to distinguish from calculations.
- **Off-sheet Links**: Distinctive formatting to identify external dependencies.
- **Formulas**: Standard black font for transparency.
- **Timeline**: Consistent granularity (e.g., monthly or annual) aligned with the master date spine.
- **Named Styles**: Use of named cell styles is encouraged to enhance auditability and scalability.

## 🏗️ 8-Step Financial Modeling Methodology

All modeling tasks should follow this structured approach:

1. **Clarify Scope**: Define objectives and boundaries.
2. **Model Architecture**: Design the structural layout and flow.
3. **Key Assumptions**: Identify and centralize all model inputs.
4. **Timeline & Scenarios**: Set up the master date spine and scenario manager.
5. **Sheet-by-Sheet Build**: Detail objectives, layouts, and representative formulas.
6. **3-Statement Integration**: Connect the P&L, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow.
7. **KPIs & Dashboards**: Build out metrics and visual reporting.
8. **Quality Control**: Perform rigorous auditing and sensitivity testing.

## 🛠 Usage

To run a full audit on a financial model workbook:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (e.g., `openpyxl`, `pyspellchecker`).
2. Run the main audit script located in the `Workings/` directory:

```bash
python Workings/full_audit.py
```

3. The findings will be output to a consolidated Markdown report (e.g., `Audit Report.md`) in the root directory.
