# Financial Model Auditor 📊

This repository provides an automated auditing framework for Excel-based financial models. It utilizes a multi-agent persona architecture to perform comprehensive checks on structural integrity, logical consistency, formatting standards, and industry-specific business rules.

## 🤖 Multi-Agent Audit Framework

The audit is orchestrated by the **Manager** agent, which coordinates specialized personas defined in the `.Jules/` directory:

- **Manager 👔**: The orchestrator who delegates tasks to specialist personas, consolidates all findings into a single, professional report, and maintains a clean workspace by removing temporary audit artifacts.
- **Architect 🏗️**: Focuses on structural robustness, scalability, master date spine alignment, and modularity.
- **Logic 🧠**: Verifies formula alignment with business context, industry standards, and identifies formula pattern breaks or hard-coded literals.
- **Efficiency ⚡**: Identifies model optimizations, including "Mega-Formulas" (>4,000 characters), unused assumptions, and redundant logic.
- **Sentry 🛡️**: Ensures technical integrity by checking for Excel error values (#REF!, #VALUE!, etc.) and calculation errors.
- **Stylist 🎨**: Detects and enforces formatting conventions (colors, fonts, styles) using style guides or statistical inference.
- **Lingo 🗣️**: Performs linguistic scans for typos and ensures consistent terminology across labels and headings.
- **VBA 📦**: Audits VBA code for security, performance, error handling, and coding standards.
- **Power Query ⚡**: Audits Power Query M code for data quality, performance, and structural integrity.

## 📏 Standards & Conventions

Financial models in this repository are expected to follow the **Corality-style** conventions:

- **Inputs**: Dark Red (#800000) font, no fill.
- **Off-sheet Links**: Green (Indexed 16) font.
- **Formulas**: Black font.
- **Timeline**: 5-year forecast with monthly granularity for the first year and annual summaries thereafter.
- **Named Styles**: Use of named cell styles (e.g., 'Table Heading', 'Standard Assumption') is encouraged for scalability.

## 🏗️ 8-Step Financial Modeling Methodology

All modeling tasks should follow this structured approach:

1. **Clarify Scope**: Define objectives and boundaries.
2. **Model Architecture**: Design the structural layout and flow.
3. **Key Assumptions**: Identify and centralize all model inputs.
4. **Timeline & Scenarios**: Set up the master date spine and scenario manager.
5. **Sheet-by-Sheet Build**: Detail objectives, layouts, and representative formulas.
6. **3-Statement Integration**: Connect the P&L, Balance Sheet, and Cash Flow.
7. **KPIs & Dashboards**: Build out metrics and visual reporting.
8. **Quality Control**: Perform rigorous auditing and sensitivity testing.

## 🛠 Usage

To run a full audit on a financial model workbook:

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed (e.g., `openpyxl`, `pyspellchecker`).
2. Run the main audit script located in the `Workings/` directory:

```bash
python Workings/full_audit.py
```

3. The findings will be output to a consolidated Markdown report (e.g., `Audit Report.md`) in the root directory.
