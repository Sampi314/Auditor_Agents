# Efficiency Memory

- **Mega-Formula Threshold:** 4,000 characters is used as the standard for flagging extreme bad practice.
- **Deep Logic Check:** Formulas in the `One Line` sheet (rows 11 and 14) are technically functioning (no Excel errors) but are flagged as "Auditability Risks" due to extreme complexity.
- **Bad Practice:** Even functioning formulas must be flagged if they compromise the model's auditability.
