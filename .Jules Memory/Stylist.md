# Stylist Memory

- **Style Legend:** The workbook uses sheet `L` as the primary style guide.
- **Color Convention:**
    - Inputs: Dark Red (`#800000`)
    - Links: Green (`Indexed 16`)
- **Findings:** Significant portions of the workbook deviate from these conventions (e.g., inputs using `Indexed 23` or links using `None` font color).
- **Grouping:** 2D range grouping is necessary for professional reporting of systemic formatting issues.
