# Architect Memory

- **Modularity Failure:** Identified that condensing complex logic into single-row "One-Line" Mega-Formulas is a structural modularity failure.
- **Structural Integrity:** Mega-formulas represent "black boxes" that compromise the robustness and scalability of the financial model.
- **Scalability:** Recommended breaking out complex calculations into modular steps for better maintenance.
