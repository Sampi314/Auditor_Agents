# Manager Memory

- **Audit Coordination:** Successfully orchestrated an audit across Lingo, Logic, Sentry, and Stylist personas.
- **Reporting Standards:** Strict requirement for non-truncated cell lists. 2D range compression (e.g., `A1:B10`) is the preferred way to list multiple affected cells.
- **Workbook Context:** The audited file is a Corality-style tutorial model.
