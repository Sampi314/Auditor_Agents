### 📋 Consolidated Audit Findings

| Sheet Name | Cell Reference | Description of the Location | Short Error Category | Long Description of Error |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| **Assum_Pricing** | C27:C30 | AU SkyBrew / AllDark Excise per HL | **Excise Error** | 🔴 **HIGH:** Australian Excise calculation misses the 1.15% ABV non-taxable threshold for beer. Current formula: `Rate * ABV * 100`. Expected: `Rate * (ABV - 1.15%) * 100`. |
| **Global** | Workbook | Working Capital / Cash Flow | **Logical Flaw** | 🔴 **HIGH:** GST (10%) is completely missing from the model. Australian brewery models must account for GST collected on sales and GST paid on inputs (Net GST Payable/Receivable) in Working Capital. |
| **IS** | B39:DU39 | Income Tax — P&L | **Logical Flaw** | 🟡 **LOW:** Tax calculation `=-MAX(0,EBT)*Rate` does not account for Tax Loss Carry Forwards. If the business incurs losses in early periods, these should offset future taxable income. |
| **Calc_Revenue** | B12:DU12 (multiple) | Gross Revenue — Time Series | **Formula Pattern Break** | ⚠️ **MEDIUM:** Inconsistent formula pattern found every 12th column (e.g., N, Z, AL). While this represents annual escalation, the first month of each year uses a different calculation logic than the subsequent 11 months. |
| **Checks** | B10:B20 | Various Integrity Checks | **Sentry Check** | ✅ **PASS:** All model integrity checks (Balance Sheet balance, Cash flow tie-in, etc.) currently resolve to TRUE or zero variance. |
| **All Sheets** | N/A | Entire Workbook | **Broken Reference** | ✅ **PASS:** No `#REF!`, `#DIV/0!`, or `#VALUE!` errors detected in the active calculation ranges. |

### 👔 Manager's Summary & Recommendations

1.  **Immediate Fix Required (Excise):** The Excise Duty is being over-calculated by approx. 23% (for a 5% ABV beer) because the 1.15% ABV threshold is ignored. This significantly impacts Net Revenue and EBITDA.
2.  **Missing Component (GST):** The model is currently "GST exclusive" in its cash flows. In a real Australian business context, the timing of GST payments/refunds can have a material impact on monthly liquidity.
3.  **Consistency:** Technically, the model is very robust with no broken links or circular references. The formatting is consistent with financial modeling best practices.
